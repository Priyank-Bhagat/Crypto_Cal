# crypto_calc

CryptoCalc is an app that gets you the latest prices and flow of crypto currency💸.

## Demo

Users can open the app directly and view the currency price and 24h up⬆️/low⬇️ and other info too on the main page of the screen.

Users can also see the cryptocurrency price from the previous month by just clicking🖱️ on the currency logo/name.

The App auto updates the latest price 👾, but for user convenience, we implemented a refresh button to update prices manually.
